A* for Lua
==========

A clean, simple implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm for Lua.

This implementation has no dependencies and has a simple interface. It takes a table of nodes, a start and end point and a "valid neighbor" function which makes it easy to adapt the module's behavior, especially in circumstances where valid paths would frequently change.

## Usage example ##

	-- this function determines which neighbors are valid (e.g., within range)
	local valid_node_func = function ( node, neighbor ) 
	
		local MAX_DIST = 300
			
		-- helper function in the a-star module, returns distance between points
		if astar.distance ( node.x, node.y, neighbor.x, neighbor.y ) < MAX_DIST then
			return true
		end
		return false
	end
	
	local path = astar.path ( start_node, end_node, all_nodes, valid_node_func )
	
	if path then
		-- do something with path (a lua table of ordered nodes from start to end)
	end
	
## Notes ##

This assumes that nodes are objects (tables) with (at least) members "x" and "y" that hold the node's coordinates.

	node = {}
	node.x = 123
	node.y = 456
	node.foo = "bar"
